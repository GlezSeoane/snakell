# snakell (yet experimental)

A snake game TUI version writing on Haskell.

![Screen capture demo](doc/demo.gif?raw=true "Demo")

Really the first purpose of this project has been serves me as an introduction to Haskell, since I have never worked with this language before, and Brick. But finally I like the game performance and have the intention to god on developing it to achieve a cool snake game terminal version.

## To use

Clone this repo and, from its root directory, run:

```
stack build && stack exec snakell
```

Another better set up options will be added soon.
